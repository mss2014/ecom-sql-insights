## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **MySQL** for database querying
- **Online Shop 2024: dataset

## üîç Key SQL Queries and Insights

### 1. üì¶ Basic Monthly Summary
```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS year,MONTH(order_date) AS month,SUM(total_price) AS revenue,COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### 2. üìÖ Monthly Insights for Specific Year (e.g., 2024)
```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(order_date), COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume, SUM(total_price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### 3. üèÜ Top 5 Revenue Months
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date), SUM(total_price) AS revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Monthly Average Order Value (AOV)
```sql
SELECT 
YEAR(order_date) AS year,MONTH(order_date) AS month,SUM(total_price) AS revenue,COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
ROUND(SUM(total_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id), 2) AS aov
FROM orders
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### 5. üë§ Quarterly Summary View
```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS year,QUARTER(order_date) AS quarter,SUM(total_price) AS revenue,COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY year, quarter
ORDER BY year, quarter;
```

## üß† Additional Business Insights

### ‚úîÔ∏è Successful Payments Per Month
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date), SUM(p.amount) AS successful_payments
FROM payments p
JOIN orders o ON p.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE p.transaction_status = 'Success'
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date);
```

### üöö Orders Not Yet Shipped
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date), COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS unshipped_orders
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN shipments s ON o.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE s.shipment_status IS NULL OR s.shipment_status != 'Shipped'
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date);
```

### üíµ Average Order Value
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date), AVG(total_price) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date);
```

### üåü Monthly Review Trends
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(review_date), MONTH(review_date), COUNT(review_id) AS total_reviews, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM reviews
GROUP BY YEAR(review_date), MONTH(review_date);
```

### üõí Top 5 Selling Products by Quantity
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date), p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM order_items oi
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date), p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
